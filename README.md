## ‚ö°Ô∏è What It Does

Fully automates payments, submissions, tracking and notifications for AI-powered SaaS product that delivers before/after mockups for service-based businesses (landscapers, painters, roofers, contractors, etc.)‚Äîso you only have to run one manual step (generate the image in ChatGPT‚Äôs Sora).

## üîß Workflow

1. **Customer pays $20** on Gumroad  
2. **Access to Tally.so form** is granted  
3. **Tally form** collects:
   - Photo upload  
   - Mockup type (landscaping, kitchen, pool, etc.)  
   - ZIP code, budget, email  
4. **Zapier automation**:
   - Appends submission to Airtable 
   - Sends customer confirmation email  
   - Notifies you via Gmail  
5. **Manual step**: You generate the before/after in Sora (ChatGPT) & email the final mockup to your client.  

## üéØ Why It Matters
- **Hands-free**: Zero upkeep on payment flow, data capture or notifications  
- **Centralized tracking**: Single Airtable table for all jobs, statuses and dates  
- **Better CX**: Instant confirmations and updates keep customers in the loop
